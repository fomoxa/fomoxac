//! `--watch`, driven at the library level rather than through the real
//! binary.
//!
//! `watch::run` polls in a loop with real (short) sleeps, so exercising it
//! properly means letting time actually pass - a real subprocess per
//! scenario (as `tests/cli.rs` prefers) would work too, but multiplies that
//! wait by however many scenarios there are. A background thread inside this
//! process, talking to the exact same `fomoxac::watch::run` the CLI calls,
//! gets the same coverage in a fraction of the time; `tests/cli.rs` still
//! covers `--watch` once, end to end, through the compiled binary.
